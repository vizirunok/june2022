        Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[36] is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the spouse
        of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 pounds), lazy,
        and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love,

        protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.

        <b>Selma Bouvier-Terwilliger-Hutz-McClure-Discothèque-Simpson-D'Amico</b> (née Bouvier) is one of Marge's older
        chain-smoking twin sisters. She works at the DMV and possesses a strong dislike for her brother-in-law, Homer,
        although on extremely rare occasions she shows kindness towards him and seems to tolerate him. She seems to despise
        Homer slightly less than her twin sister, Patty Bouvier.
